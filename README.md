## ‚ö°Ô∏è Things I like working with

### üíª Operating Systems

[![Arch Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch_Linux-1793D1?style=for-the-badge&logo=arch-linux&logoColor=white)](https://archlinux.org/)
[![Windows 11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white)](https://www.microsoft.com/windows)
[![Debian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Debian-A81D33?style=for-the-badge&logo=debian&logoColor=white)](https://www.debian.org/)

Currently dualbooting, doing most of my dev stuff on Arch and the rest on Windows. I'm also a Debian user for all of my server needs, it allows me to quickly deploy production ready solutions !

### üë©‚Äçüíª Languages

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

I learned C and C++ during my scholarship at EPITECH, where I also had the occasion of applying this knowlege through various projects. Outside of school, I kept on using C++ to build tools and solutions on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico platforms.

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![.Net](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=.net&logoColor=white)

I picked up an interest in C# after wanting to develop my own applications for Windows. The versatile aspect of this programming language allowed me to explore fullstack development, as well as web APIs and command line tools for pure computing. I also applied this knowledge on multiple occasions in a professional setting, on useful and defined projects.

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/Typescript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

These languages allowed me to build various tools and applications. I used Typescript to build multiple web apps, and Python to create a whole lot of different things(Flask, Tensorflow, etc...). I am currently learning Rust to build high-performance applications (especially for embedded systems), and I am really enjoying it so far. I use Docker to deploy all of my applications that need it.

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Systems

![MSSQL Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft%20SQL%20Server-CC2927?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft%20sql%20server&logoColor=white)
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-4169E1?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

Throughout my different projects, I had the opportunity to work with various databases. I learned how to use them, and how to interact with them through different programming languages. I also learned how to deploy and manage them in a production environment.

### üñ•Ô∏è Development Environments

![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)
![Visual Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio&logoColor=white)

VSCode is my go-to IDE for most of my projects. I use it for C, C++, Python, Typescript and Rust. I also use Visual Studio for C# development, as it provides a lot of useful features that are not available in VSCode.

Thanks to the Github Student program, I also enjoyed using JetBrains IDEs, especially CLion and Pycharm. I used Clion for my C and C++ projects to take advantage of its powerful debugging and refactoring tools.

### üí° Other Software

![Gimp Gnu Image Manipulation Program](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gimp-657D8B?style=for-the-badge&logo=gimp&logoColor=FFFFFF)
![Kicad](https://img.shields.io/badge/KiCad-4B8BBE?style=for-the-badge&logo=kicad&logoColor=white)
![Fusion 360](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fusion%20360-FF6A1B?style=for-the-badge&logo=fusion-360&logoColor=white)
![Cura Slicer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cura-3D9FE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=ultimaker-cura&logoColor=white)

These are the software I use for my various projects. I use Gimp for image manipulation, KiCad for PCB design, Fusion 360 for 3D modeling and Cura for 3D printing.
